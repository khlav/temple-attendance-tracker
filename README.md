## Installation

To run this, you will need:

* Python 3.6 or above
* Git, in order to git clone the repository
* A few python packages: requests, gspread, pandas

### Installing python

If you are not sure if you have python installed, you can check by opening a terminal window (use cmd.exe or powershell in Windows) and run
```console
python --version
```
If you get an error, you need to install python.

It is probably easiest to go to the website and install it from there: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once install has completed, check it is working properly:
```console
python --version
```

### Installing required packages

Installing the required python packages should be pretty simple with pip.

```console
pip install requests
pip install pandas
pip install gspread
```

### Installing git

This is needed to not only clone the repository to begin with, but will also allow you to keep up to date with any future changes.

If you are on Windows and not a developer, there is a good chance Git is not installed. However, you can still check with:
```console
git --help
```
This is another tool that is probably best downloaded from the website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Git doesn't seem to work well in Powershell without a special package posh-git, at least for me, but I've had success with running this and successive steps on cmd.exe.
Once installed, check that the command works with `git --help`.
